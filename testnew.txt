What is this Am I in a movie
Dont be stupid This is more entertaining than Hollywood is ever gonna be
YEAH YOU GOT FUCKED
Ugh Er Well feels like my heads still attached my sunglasses arent broken Amen hallelujah and peanut butter
Hey boss Dont you remember Well you should Im already dead You said it remember And by the way my name is Rock now
Im Jewish remember Fuck the Nazis is a family creed
 So thats how you look at it huh I see Well since were here Ive got a story thats perfect for this sort of atmosphere Im gonna do you a favour and let you in on a little secret Rock Okay Let me ask you something See this And this  What would you say these two things are
wary The first ones an old skull  and thats some sort of medal
Thats where youre wrong Both of these are just things As soon as you strip away their meanings then thats all they really are Just things and nothing more And if youre gonna give these things any kind of meaning again they wont get any other value because of someones precious memory Their value will be determined by the one thing everyone agrees on tinkles the Iron Cross And thats money The rest of it is just a bunch of sentimental bullshit
disquieted Hm Is money your God
Its power Something a lot more useful than God And Rock if you think about it other than this what do we really value in life God Love Dont make me laugh Back when I was just a brat crawling around that shithole city it seemed God and Love were always sold out when I went looking Before I knew better I clung to God and prayed to Him every single night  yeah I believed in God right up until that night the cops beat the hell out of me for no reason at all All they saw when they looked at me was another little ghetto rat With no power and no God whats left for a poor little Chinese bitch to rely on Its money of course and guns Fuckin A With these two things the worlds a great place
I wish I hadnt heard that Im sorry
Fuck you
Huh
If I was looking for pity I wouldve told you something a lot more colourful The moral of the story is when youre livin on the edge thats all that matters to you because thats all youve really got Not everyone can get off on being normal Rock And one more thing All those rich fat bastards living under palmtrees  and bitches who think that lifes only about putting on makeup I dont want to hear you speaking your mind from the same perspective as those hypocrites Nothings worse than being treated like some whore by your companions Ill say this once The next time you decide youre gonna tell me whats proper youll no longer be one of us When that happens I am going to kill you
Know what You should go back to Japan Youre just not cut out for this
Well youre the one who invited me
Yep Really fucked up there
I wonder maybe you can tell me who kept the church from becoming a bloodbath today Its just like the old lady said you cant solve everything with a gun
Im warning you you better watch what you say Rock
Youve been like this ever since the submarine Was it our talk
Who cares stamps out cigarette I told you to never talk about that again
puts his noodle soup bowl down ominously Revy Im not gonna apologise anymore picks bowl back up and continues eating as if nothing has happened
eyes flare open with sheer incredulity  I mustve misheard you You better hope I did otherwise youre a fuckin dead man
with a hint of iron Is that so
slams his bowl down on the table and stands up
In that case Ill say it again I didnt make any mistake I have nothing to apologize for Thats what Im saying
frozen in pure rage but its abruptly gone she rises with a cold dead look in her eyes Thats a shame You just stepped on a nonnegotiable bigass fucking landmine
draws her weapon scaring the townspeople away cocks the hammer and places the barrel against Rocks forehead
Like I said a real shame Theres just one last thing I need to ask you What do you want on your tombstone Cocksucker
narrows his eyes Why dont you write theres no cure for a fool with a gun
Well Rock Goodbye See ya pulls trigger the Cutlass fires and once the smoke clears we see her stock still with surprise
has grabbed the slide at the last moment and forced the pistol aside grazing his temple but is otherwise unharmed Rrrgh See that There are some problems you cant solve with a gun disarms her
Theres a noose that hangs at the entrance to the city Its a message to be read by all who encounter it For the cautious the sane its a warning For the reckless the wild at heart an invitation they cannot refuse The worst of the criminal underworld gather here They come here from across the world to butt heads and jostle for power An evil city caught between the east and the west founded during the Cold War and nurtured by many who came here to ride the wave of the illegal drug trade sweeping across the continent The edge of the world the crucible of hypocrisy a place where those whose souls have been destroyed in the relentless search for money and power reside A final stop on the way to hell How have I managed to stay alive this long With the help of three people Dutch Revy and Benny Also known as the Lagoon Company The name of this city is spoken of among the villains of the world Many who come here to make a name for themselves are swallowed by the darkness never to return A cruel fate awaits any halfassed small time crook who accidentally stumbles into Roanapur Right now another sacrificial lamb has wandered too far from home The city awaits
Sister Eda What the hell is your problem Dont you remember what Jesus said in Luke 11 Dont trouble me The door is locked Got that Bitch
But this is a church isnt it
So what Gods not in today Hes on vacation in Vegas all right
Its been 35 years since this rotten harbor town became a den of vice Roanapur has managed to stay out of CNNs evening news or the dinner topic of housewives only because from the past to the present the motives of those whove gathered here have always been consistent That is its in our mutual interest to lead the public eye away from our more stimulating businesses for the peace of mind of those who are crooked Please remember this If we continue suspecting each other continue pursuing our own selfinterests who do you think will be left standing in the ring in the end There wont be anybody there ladies and gentlemen Not you not me Not even the ring itself
Your laugh is like the skeletons on El Dia de los Muertos
 Hah Hahahahahahaha Thats right Im surprised you noticed little girl I came all the way from the land of the dead from the dark depths of the tomb gun in hand We all did Me your head matron those soldiers the people in this town every last one of us So little girl Offer up some marigolds and some cuervo Then to the poor little girl whos about to die far away in Asia Ill offer her some chocolate Aha ha ha ha
Better run through the jungle
My job Yes My job is to be an enemy of the state
Surely you must still have some sense of justice
flicks cigarette away and throws off her greatcoat Enough Rock Ive had it Sambo throwslams him onto the hood of her car and puts her Stechkin APS under his nose
Revy and Boris draw their guns on each other its a standoff
Damn it  Lets all calm down What do ya say sis We dont want to reenact a scene from My Bloody Valentine here do we
mildly Shut it Revy glacial Rock Look at me Justice I cant think of another word more loved by the people It does have a nice ring to it However Without ever exercising your own strength you seek the death of others at the hands of someone else Huh well The justice you refer to smells pretty rotten to me The stench of a bloodbath now speaking soft and motherly Wouldnt you agree
squirms under her grip and tries to turn away
Dont give me that look Rock After all Im not upset with you
Sis
Of all the people I know I just never thought Id hear those words coming from you Im  amused Thats all this is
Alright Youve made your point Now just let him go My fingers are twitching
In the grand scheme our lives are insignificant Theyre light as air much like a candy wrapper
Im really not in the mood to talk right now Just let him go
And TwoHands I have something to say to you I dont know whats going on in that head of yours but it will only bring you disappointment if you hope to have a life like his
harsh whisper Shut up I know I know what youre saying okay So please just shut up now Im warning you Ive just about reached my limit
 Ms Balalaika Your victory here is assured And You no longer have anything to lose so  isnt that 
Rock
Isnt that enough for you
Oh fucking idiot
No it isnt enough There are two things to remember when youre begging for your life one is to try and entertain the person holding the gun to your head and the other is to give that person malevolent grin Mmm A convincing reason why they shouldnt kill you But you havent managed to do either one of those things So lets hear it What obligation do you have to save them anyway
terrified out of his mind Youre misunderstanding
Oh
Its not an obligation and its got nothing to do with justice The only reason I want to do it is because  its my hobby
singsong Hobby
Yeah thats right Some people like to die in the gutters others like to go to war Then theres me When it comes down to it Im really no different from you
 Uh hn hnhnhnhnhhnhnhnhnhn AHA HA HA HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH AHA HAHAHAHA Haaa Haaaaaa Oh lets him go and picks up her greatcoat  Things are gonna pick up again tomorrow Rock Oh and from here on I think youd be wise not to risk your life on stupid games tosses keys in his lap Park the car somewhere will you Thanks
